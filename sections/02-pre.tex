\subsection{Problem Statement}

\stitle{Machine learning task.}

The setting of our problems.

Input:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A small training set with lots of unlabeled data
	\item A validation (test) set
	\item A user-specified downstream model
\end{itemize}

Output: A trained downstream model with best performance on the test set.
