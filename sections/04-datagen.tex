\section{Synthetic Data Generation} 
\label{sec:datagen}

\nan{This section should be only about data generation, no need to discuss RL, but we need to justify why we choose LSTM, not other models such as VAEs or diffusion models.}

\begin{itemize}
	\item (State) How to encode the features, \ie categorical feature and numerical data.
	\item (Action) The output of the generative model.
	\item (Model design) The RNN model.
	\item How to train the RNN model, \ie the Actor-Critic framework.
\end{itemize}
